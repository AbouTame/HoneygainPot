## How to change the schedule to fit with my timezone before the pot is reset?

Well, GitHub uses UTC time (UTC +0) for scheduling workflows, so we should convert it to our timezone.

For example: If I want to set the daily trigger to trigger at 9:00 PM (UTC +7), I have to set it to 2:00 PM or 14:00 (24-hour format) (UTC¬±0) (2+7=9).

```
name: Daily claim
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 14 * * *' # <- UTC Time, replace 0 14
```
So, if I want the daily trigger to run at 5:00 AM (UTC +7), I have to set it to 10:00 PM (UTC¬±0) (use 24-hour format):
```
name: Daily claim
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 22 * * *' # UTC Time
```

## Note

GitHub Actions schedules can sometimes be delayed by up to 15 minutes due to high demand, so don‚Äôt worry!
